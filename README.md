# Tool-Box
a Powershell gui script that contains some useful tools for active directory i made while messing around.
it includes:
Password reset, User Unlocking (unlocks disabled users), Shared folder permission granting via Gui, Computer creation with random generated name from a chosen pool etc..

some features wont work since prio fixing is needed to change some values to fit your company active directory and more so plaese the comments i left :)
